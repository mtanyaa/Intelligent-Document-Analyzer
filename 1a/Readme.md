# PDF Document Heading Extraction with YOLO, OCR, and Docker

## Overview

This project automates the extraction of section headings and titles from PDF documents using deep learning (YOLOv8), Optical Character Recognition (Tesseract OCR), and image processingâ€”all efficiently containerized via Docker.

Given a directory of PDF files, it processes each, detects the title and section headings, assigns hierarchical heading levels (H1â€“H4) based on detected bounding box sizes, and outputs one structured JSON per PDF file.

## Approach

**Key Steps:**
1. **PDF-to-Image Conversion**: Each PDF is converted into per-page images using [pdf2image], enabling downstream visual processing.
2. **Heading Detection (YOLOv8)**: Each image is processed by a YOLOv8 model (pre-trained on document layouts) to detect probable `title` and `section-header` regions.
3. **OCR Extraction (Tesseract)**: For each detected heading region, the text is extracted using Tesseract OCR.
4. **Text Heuristics**: Heuristics filter out non-heading text (like footers, dates, page numbers).
5. **Heading Hierarchy Assignment**: Detected headings are classified into levels (H1, H2, etc.) based on bounding box heights using percentile thresholds.
6. **JSON Output**: For each PDF, a JSON is created summarizing document title and outline in the specified format.

## ðŸ—ƒ Directory Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py            # Main application script
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile        # Docker build instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # (this file)
```
- **/app/input/**: (Mounted) Input directory for PDF files.
- **/app/output/**: (Mounted) Output directory for results.

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. **Prerequisites**

- Docker installed on your system.
- Your PDF files placed in a local `input/` directory.
- (Output results will appear in a local `output/` directory.)

### 2. **Build the Docker Image**

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t mysolutionname:somerandomidentifier .
```

### 3. **Prepare Input/Output Folders**

On your host system:
- Place all PDFs you want to process into an `input/` folder in your current directory.
- Create an empty `output/` folder (results will be saved here).

### 4. **Run the Container**

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \
  --network none \
  mysolutionname:somerandomidentifier
```

- `--rm` â€” cleans up the container after finishing.
- `-v` â€” mounts the `input` and `output` directories so data is exchanged with your host.

### 5. **Review Output**

For every `filename.pdf` in `input/`, youâ€™ll get a corresponding `filename.json` in `output/` with this structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "outline": [
    {"page": 1, "text": "First Main Heading", "level": "H1"},
    {"page": 1, "text": "Subsection", "level": "H2"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure your input PDFs are valid.
- The Docker container must be built for `linux/amd64` (which is required for compatibility).
- Container logs will display any errors encountered during processing.
- No model weights or output data should be placed in your repository; the model is downloaded at build/runtime.

## â„¹Notes

- **No input/output or model files** are included in this repository.
- All output is non-interactive. Once the container exits, check the `output/` directory for results.
- If a PDF cannot be processed, the script will continue with the next file and log the error.
